=== Class Stockfish ===

Purpose:
	This class is used to interface with a stockfish process running as a child of this process.
	Encapsulates the whole process of:
		- finding the stockfish executable
		- running it as a child process
		- connecting to it using pipes (or streams)
		- interacting with it using the UCI
			- create and parse UCI messages

Uses:
	- generate legal moves
	- evaluate a position using stockfish

Class UML:
	class Stockfish : UciEngine
		- process - boost::process::child
		- out - boost::process::opstream
		- in - boost::process::ipstream

		// Starts stockfish as a child process. Redirects its std_in std_out streams to pipes.
		+ start()
		+ start(path_to_stockfish_exe)
		
		+ eval(Position) - int			// gets eval from stockfish
		+ movegen(Position)	- MoveList	// generates legal moves 

		+ print()

		+ close()	// Optional: Closes stockfish app. Will close from destructor automatically.
