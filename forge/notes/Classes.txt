Match:
	Clock	   - keeps track of each players time and move numbers
	GameLogger - records game moves and saves to a file when game finishes
	ChessBoard - Stores positions of all pieces
	Controller - looks at ChessBoard, Clock, ... and makes moves
		whiteController
		blackController

GameLogger (BookKeeper?): (Not used in solver but good for bookeeping)
	moves					vector<Move>		// a move stored as PGN or LAN
												// even numbers are whites moves
												// odds are blacks moves

Move : string:
	toPGN()	- Move
	toLAN() - Move
	isPGN() - bool
	isLAN() - bool
	set(ChessBoard lastMove, ChessBoard currMove) - void

Controller:

SolverBase:
	solve() - best move sequence (or best "line")
	SolverStatistics - periodically sends info to UCI
	
SolverStatistics:
	// These values need to be sent to UCI periodically
	nodes per second searched
	currmove - Should send the move currently being evaluated to UCI (only the 1st ply)

heuristic::Base:
	eval() - int (units of centipawns)
