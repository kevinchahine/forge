Overfitting:
	To help prevent overritting, where the same positions are used multiple times on successive
	training states, consider starting each game with a slightly randomized position.
	Start each game by making a few random moves by each player, then have the AI's start playing
	from their. That way the AI's will be forced to train in positions that they may unlikely
	put themselves in on their own. Also, this is good because it can prepare the AI for opponents 
	that may try to use very uncommon moves forcing the AI to play in a positions that it is not 
	familiar with.

	We can also tell the engine to randomly choose to make a random move in the middle of the game.
