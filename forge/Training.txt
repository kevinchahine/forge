Overfitting:
	To help prevent overritting, where the same positions are used multiple times on successive
	training states, consider starting each game with a slightly randomized position.
	Start each game by making a few random moves by each player, then have the AI's start playing
	from their. That way the AI's will be forced to train in positions that they may not put themselves
	in on their own. Also, this is good because it can prepare the AI for opponents that may try to pull
	very uncommon moves forcing the AI to play in a positions that it is not familiar with.
