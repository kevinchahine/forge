Things we will need to calculate:
	- threatened squares
	- King pins
	- Direction of King pins
	- Square of checking pieces
	- Checks
	- Double Checks
	- Is attacker blockable (Only ray pieces can be blocked)
	- Is attacker defended (If so, our king can't capture it)
	- Where can we move King to safty

1.) Who's turn is it anyway?

2.) Calculate BitBoard for threats against King.
	- We are only conserned with the 9 squares that suround and hold the King.
	- We need each direction attackable by opponent:
		- If they have diagonal pieces (QB) we need to search diagonal
		- If they have lateral pieces (QR) we need to search lateral
		- If they have knights (N) we need to search knight moves
		- If they have pawns (p) we need to search 1 diagonal move forward
		* When evaluating these, we need to remove King from board (or just ignore it)
	- Call these "KingDangerSquares"
	
3.) Determine how many times King is attacked.
	3-2.) King is attacked 2 times (Double-Check)
	3-1.) King is attacked 1 time (Single-Check)
	3-0.) King is not attacked
