!!! Things we still need to add to procedure: 
	- pawns doing enpassent while king pinned
	- castling while being attacked
		and while King-Rook squares are attacked
	- pawn promotions for pinned pawns (Don't think we need to worry about this one)
		Because if a pawn can move up (upleft, up or upright) then it can do it as a promotion.

Procedure:

1.) Which player is making a turn?
currPlayer
Find currPlayers King: king

2.) Start by getting some values that we will use throughout algorithm
	Find all cells that are being attacked by opponent
		* This tells us which of our pieces are pinned
	Find all opponent pieces that are defended	
		* This tells us what opponent pieces our king can't capture

3.) Find which of our pieces are pinned to King (King Pins).
	- remember direction of pin.
		- for each King Pin:
			- find direction of pin:
				- attackedByRay<Up>() - bool (Or these can return BoardSquare of attacker !!!Or even BitBoard!!!)
				- attackedByRay<Down>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<Left>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<Right>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<UpRight>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<UpLeft>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<DownRight>() - bool
				- attackedByRay<DownLeft>() - bool
				* Remember: knights, pawns and kings can't perform pins
				*	Only Ray pieces can. Therefore we don't care if knights, pawns
				*	or kings are attacking a piece.
	- pieces can only be pinned to Kings by ray pieces and
	- can only move/capture in direction of that ray piece (or stay where they are)

2.) Is King attacked?
	Yes.) Then all legal moves involve getting the King out of check:
		2-1.) Find opponent pieces that are attacking the King. - BitBoard
		2-2.) How many attackers are there? 1, 2, (can more than 2 pieces attack a King? Don't think so)
			2-2-2.) 2 attackers are only possible after discovered attacks:
				Possibilities:
					- Ray Piece and Knight (common):	
						QN	(Q attacks laterally or diagonally)	
						BN		
						RN	
					- Lateral ray piece and Pawn (only possible after doing enpassent)
						QP (BQ attacks down only) (WQ attacks up only)		
						RP (BR attacks down only) (WR attacks up only)
						?BP? (Not possible)		
					- Ray piece and Ray piece:	
						QQ (Only possible after pawn promotion)	
						QB (Queen can only attack laterally)	
						QR (Queen can only attack diagonally)
						BR 
						?BB? (Not possible in a regular game)
						?RR? (Not possible in a regular game)
				Not Possibles:
					N and N
					NP
					K and anything
					P and P

			2-2-1.) 1 Attacker:
				Only legal moves:
				- Capture pieces with non-King (Make sure piece is not pinned to King)
				- Capture pieces with King (but only if there're not defended)
				- Move King to safe square
				- If attacker is a ray pieces (QBR):
					- Block ray pieces 
						(blockers must not be pinned in any way)
			2-2-2.) 2 Attackers:
				Only legal moves:
				Things we can't do:
					~ Capture either piece with non-king (Then the other is still dealing check)
					~ Block either piece (Then the other is still dealing check)
				Only thing we can do:
					- Move King to safe square
					- Capture 1 piece with king (only if its not defended)

	No.) King is not attacked
		Pieces pinned to king can only move in direction of pinning piece (We can assume it to be a ray piece)
			- pieces can only be pinned to king by a single attacker. (true)
			- two attackers can't pin the same piece to its king (only one can)
			- only ray pieces can deliver pins
		** No piece can be skewered to King (because Kings are the most valuable piece)
		** Knights and pawns can only deliver forks (no pins nor skewers)

		For King Pinned pieces, list all moves/captures they can make in direction of attacker ray piece

		For each other piece, list all moves/captures they can make
		For pawns don't forget enpassent and promotions.
			For a pawn that is pinned, it cannot do enpassent in any cercumstance (Is this true???)
