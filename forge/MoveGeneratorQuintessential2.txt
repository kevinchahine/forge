!!! Things we still need to add to procedure: 
	- pawns doing enpassent while king pinned
	- castling while being attacked
	- pawn promotions for pinned pawns (Don't think we need to worry about this one)

Pseudo-Code:
Terminology:
	King pin - a piece that is pinned to its King.
	vulnerable - a piece that isn't defended by atleast one of its own pieces
	front - Only applies to pawns. Direction a pawn moves.

1.) --- Which player is making a turn? ---
	c = Current player
	o = Opponent player
	k = c's King

2.) --- Preprocessing ---
	Calculate some things that will be used later in this algorithm:
		- Which squares are attacked by o?
		??? Which of our pieces are king pinned? (Maybe we can find this out later in algorithm?)

3.) --- Is King under attack? ---
	3-Yes.) Yes our King is under attack. 
		--- But by how many pieces? --- 
		3-Yes-One.) King is only attacked by 1 opponent
			The following describe the only moves that we can make:
				- Capture attacker:
					- By non-King piece
					- By King but only if attacker:
						- is vulnerable (See terminology) and
						- attacker is not a knight
				- Block Attacker:
					- Only if attacker is a ray piece:
				- Move King:
					- See threat table to find safe squares

		3-Yes-Two.) King is attacked by 2 opponents:
			Criteria for this to happen:
				- One attacker is a ray piece, and
				- other attacker is QBRN (Not Pawn nor King)
				* These criteria should be further broken down (But will likely overcomplicate things):
					If one attacker is QB attacking Diagonally:
						- Then other attacker will only be a N
						- Or a newly promoted piece
					... 
					This can get so complicated.
				- Capture Attacker: **See above
				- Move King: **See above
				X Can't block attacker X
		*** Things not possible: ***
			- Castling

	3-No.) King is not under attack.
		En passent. Not possible when:
			- pawn is pinned to King from front
			- pawn is pinned to King from ?any? diagonal (What diagonals exactly???)
		Castling: Not possible when:
			- (Accounted for above) King is attacked
			- Rook is attacked
			- King has moved
			- Rook has moved
			- Space between is attacked (What space???)
		Pinned pieces (Excluding enpassent):
			- King pinned pieces can only:	
				- Move in direction of attacker. True
				- Stay where they are
		Normal moves (pieces that are not King Pinned):
			- Queen:
				Lateral moves
				Diagonal moves
			- Bishop:
				Diagonal moves
			- Rook:
				Lateral moves
				(Accounted for above) Castling
			- Knights:
				You know
			- Pawns:
				One move up
				If not moved yet. 1-2 moves up
				Near diagonal captures
				Promotions
