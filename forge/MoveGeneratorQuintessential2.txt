!!! Things we still need to add to procedure: 
	- pawns doing enpassent while king pinned
	- castling while being attacked
	- pawn promotions for pinned pawns (Don't think we need to worry about this one)

Pseudo-Code:
Terminology:
	King pin - a piece that is pinned to its King.
	vulnerable - a piece that isn't defended by atleast one of its own pieces
	front - Only applies to pawns. Direction a pawn moves.

1.) --- Which player is making a turn? ---
	c = Current player
	o = Opponent player
	k = c's King

2.) --- Preprocessing ---
	Calculate some things that will be used later in this algorithm:
		- Which squares are attacked by o?
		??? Which of our pieces are king pinned? (Maybe we can find this out later in algorithm?)

3.) --- Is King under attack? ---
	3-Yes.) Yes our King is under attack. 
		--- But by how many pieces? --- 
		3-Yes-Two.) King is attacked by 2 opponents: (Do double checks 1st incase we can stop early)
			*** Only King moves are permitted
			Criteria for this to happen:
				- One attacker is a ray piece, and
				- other attacker is QBRN (Never a Pawn nor King)
					* These criteria should be further broken down (But will likely overcomplicate things):
						If one attacker is QB attacking Diagonally:
							- Then other attacker will only be a N (Never a Rook)
							- Or a newly promoted piece (only if King is on opponents promotion rank)
						... 
						This can get very complicated.
				- Capture Attacker: **See above
				- Move King: **See above
				X Can't block attacker X
		3-Yes-One.) King is only attacked by 1 opponent
			The following describe the only moves that we can make:
				- Capture attacker:
					- By non-King piece:
						- Remember: Enpassent can be used to capture attacking pawns (only pawns)
					- By King but only if attacker:
						- is vulnerable (See terminology) and
						- attacker is not a knight
				- Block Attacker:
					- Only if attacker is a ray piece:
					- Remember: Enpassent can be used to block attacking ray pieces
				- Move King:
					- See threat table to find safe squares

		*** Things not possible: ***
			- Castling

	3-No.) King is not under attack.
		En passent. Not possible when:
			- pawn is pinned to King from front
			- pawn is pinned to King from ?any? diagonal (What diagonals exactly???)
		Castling: Not possible when:
			- (Accounted for above) King is attacked
			- Rook is attacked
			- King has moved
			- Rook has moved
			- Space between is attacked (What space???)
		Pinned pieces:
			- King pinned pieces can only:	
				- Move towards/away from direction of attacker
				- Stay where they are
				- King Pinned knights can never move
		Normal moves 
			Is piece King Pinned?
				No. Piece is not King Pinned
					- Queen:
						Lateral moves
						Diagonal moves
					- Bishop:
						Diagonal moves
					- Rook:
						Lateral moves
						Castling (Accounted for above)
					- Knights:
						You know
					- Pawns:
						One move forward
						If not moved yet. 1-2 moves forward
						Near forward diagonal captures
						Enpassent:
							- Always make sure King is not attacked by rays.
							- enpassent can create discovered attacks for opponent.
							- only need to see horizontal attacks because, calculating pins
								will eliminate horizontal ray attacks
						Promotions
				Yes. Piece is King Pinned:
					- Then that piece can only move in direction of attacking ray piece
					- Remember, only ray pieces can deliver pins
