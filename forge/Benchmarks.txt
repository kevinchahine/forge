=== BENCHMARKS ===

=== All Benchmarks are run on a 64-bit release build. ===
=== Each metric is a measurement of the performance of a single search.
Each game is made up of multiple searches.

# Search Algorithm Variations
# Minimax:
#	Basic - No alpha-beta prunning, no move re-ordering, No Multi-threading
#	AB - Alpha-beta prunning
#	Priority - After moves are generated, each resulting position is evaluated, then they are sorted in order of best to first based on their evaluations.
#	MT - Multi-threading using dynamic tree splitting algorithm
# 
# MCTS:
#	Basic - No move re-ordering, No Multi-threading
#	Priority - After moves are generated, each resulting position is evaluated, then they are sorted in order of best to first based on their evaluations.
#	MT - Multi-threading using dynamic tree splitting algorithm
