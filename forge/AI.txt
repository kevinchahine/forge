Search algorithms:
	- must have an exit condition that can change as it is searching.
	
Exit Condition:
	- node limit
	- depth(ply) limit
	- time limit
	- stop command (from UCI)
	- or maybe even it decides on its own

Search modes:
	- search for a mate in <x> moves
	- search for best move

Analysis (Data that comes out of the search):
	(continuously updated and sent to UCI as engine is searching)
	- number of nodes searched so far 
	- selective search depth in plys
	- search depth in plys 
	- time searched
	- nodes per second searched 
	- pv (the best line found)
	- multi pv (the <k> best lines found; only in multi pv mode)
	- score (the engines approximated score in centi pawns)
	- currently searching move 
	- currently searching move number (1 is 1st move)
	- current line searching (along with what CPU is searching it.)
	- and some other stuff see "engine-interface.txt"
