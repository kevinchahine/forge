=== Benchmark Testing ===

Purpose: To evaluate performance of search algorithm using the following metrics:
	- Nodes searched per second
	- Plys searched per second (Minimax only)
	- Duration to search a full ply (Minimax only)
	- Lines searched per second (MCTS only)

Requirements:
	
Ideas:
	- Make it like the ChessMatch class. Where solvers can be set explicitly
	- Leave out Views.
	- Needs a way to access analytics from SearchMonitor class.
