=== FORGE ===
=== VALID MOVE GENERATOR ===

	- knight: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (see class Move)

	- queen: rooks and bishop combined
	- king: up, down, left, right, \, /, \\, //

Special Moves:
	- pawn promotion
	- en passent
	- castling

After generating a move:
	- Is king being attacked?		(Yes - invalid, No - valid)	
		But this check is very slow, do we want to do it every time?
		
Quinesectial Move Generation:
	1.) Is King in Check?
	Yes.) Only 3 types of moves are valid but it depends on the kind of check:
		- Move King out of check (always works as long as king can move, otherwise its a loss)
		- Move piece to square between king and attacker 
			(only applies if attacker is a ray pieces and theres only 1 attacker)
		- Capture attacker 
			(only works with 1 attacker not 2) 
			(King can only capture attacker if it is not defended)
	No.)
