=== VALID MOVE GENERATOR ===

Psudo-legal moves:
	- Generates list of possible moves, but may leave king under check.

Normal Moves (from whites perspective):
	- pawn: up1, up2, capture\, capture/
	- rook: up_x, down_x, left_x, right_x
	- knight: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (see class Move)

	- queen: rooks and bishop combined
	- king: up, down, left, right, \, /, \\, //

Special Moves:
	- pawn promotion
	- en passent

After generating a move:
	- Is king being attacked?		(Yes - invalid, No - valid)	
		But this check is very slow, do we want to do it every time?
