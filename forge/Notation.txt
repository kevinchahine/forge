Portable Game Notation (PGN):
	- Most chess databases store game in pgn
	- use pgnlib see /d/Desktop
		- We need to figure out how we can add it to project

Long Algebraic Notation:
	- UCI GUIs support this notation
	- more machine readable

Both:
	- string no longer than ??? characters
	- must be parsed
	- Can PGN be distinguished from LAN by a machine?

What about?
	- fen
	- san
