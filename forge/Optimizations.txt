=== OPTIMIZATIONS ===

Consider these optimizations:
	- MoveGenerator outputs vector<unique_ptr<Node>> instead of 
		vector<MovePositionPair> 
		Reason: When expanding Nodes, we are having to copy Positions from the MoveList 
		to the Node itself. 
	- MoveGenerator non-pseudo move generator is slow and can be implemented more efficiently.
		Instead of generating pseudo legal moves then checking to see if King is attacked,
		consider only generating move that avoid putting King is check in the 1st place.

	- MoveGenerate:
		MoveList reserves 35 elements. Maybe increase this to 60+ to prevent reallocating 
		the vector on push_backs

	- MoveList:
		pushIfLegal*() methods are very short and simple and will be called very often.
		consider making them inline

		When using Quinesential move generator, we don't want to call pushIfLegal*() methods
		anymore because the Quinesential move generator will only generate legal move anyway.
