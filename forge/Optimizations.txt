=== OPTIMIZATIONS ===

Consider these optimizations:
	- MoveGenerator outputs vector<unique_ptr<Node>> instead of 
		vector<MovePositionPair> 
		Reason: When expanding Nodes, we are having to copy Positions from the MoveList 
		to the Node itself. 
	- MoveGenerator non-pseudo move generator is slow and can be implemented more efficiently.
		Instead of generating pseudo legal moves then checking to see if King is attacked,
		consider only generating move that avoid putting King is check in the 1st place.
