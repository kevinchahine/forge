solidly with Black and go for the win with White.} 6. Bg5 {The main line.
Black cannot afford to have the kingside pawn structure broken up by a capture

aim at White's center, but this move is risky. With the bishop off the c8-h3

position. A dynamically balanced game usually results.} 10... h6 11. Be3 Re8 {
In order to achieve an advantage White will eventually capture an enemy bishop
on e6, weakening Black's kingside and gaining the bishop pair. On the other

plans have been tried here, including bringing the queen out to b3 or a4,

his domination of critical lines.} 27... Qc7 28. Ne5 {The final chance for

opening known to be bad. Writing about this game, American master Lou Hays
says, "Bluffing. McGregor, actually a strong player, wanted Fischer to think
he was a beginner." I'm not really sure that the bluff worked - wouldn't a
beginner play 3...fxe5? Fischer didn't play a particularly incisive game, but
even so, had he not played the 13.Be2 lemon - which had nothing obvious to do
with purely psychological factors - McGregor would almost surely have been
another simul victim. So, fans of dubious openings, it's true: someone played
one of the absolute worst openings against one of the world's absolute best
players and lived to tell the tale, but it's not an example worth emulating.}

for a win, Black for a draw. Often when there is just a one pawn difference
the position is theoretically a draw, but the more pawns on the board the more

to activate his rook and king and try to keep as many pawns on the board as

{The struggle between a bad bishop outside the pawn chain and a bad bishop
within the chain While Black's bad Bishop has an open diagaonal at his
disposal, the White bad bishop is condemned to a very passive role. it is
plain that Black's advantage in mobility can be exploited only in the
middlegame. An endgame may well be drawn, since the Bishops control
opposite-coloured squares. It usual to speak of "unlike Bishops", or "Bishops
of opposite colours", although these expressions are not litereally correct.
Many players have a holy dread of such bishops, since in an ending it can
happen that an advantage of two or even three pawns may not suffice to force a
win. But before an ending the Gods have placed the middlegame as Dr. Tarrasch
often remarked. And this really is quite logical; the fact that the Bishops
work on opposite colours means that one can never defend what the other
attacks. Black has attacking chances on the Kingside, and we see that through
the presence of the unlike Bishops the pressure on the White position steadily
increases.} 1... f4 {Prevents the development of the Bishop to e3 and at the

{Systematic use of the Bishop pair. Steinitz was the first to show a method
for the best utilization of the two Bishops. So far as is know, it was in the
present game that he first applied his system. The theory of Steinitz applies
to positions which are not close, but which, on the other hand, are not yet
completely open in character. White still has support points at d4 and e5. The
cornerstone of the Steinitz system is to deprive the opponent of such support
points by means of pawn advances. The hostile pieces will thus be doomed to
passivity, and the owner of the bishop pair should not find it difficult to
set a decisive attack in motion. His contemporaries pointed out the weakness
which these pawn advances must necessarily creat. Only through the games of
Steinitz was it realized that such weaknesses are not so serious because two
bishops can cover all the squares, being in this way much more useful for
neutralizing weaknesses than two Knights or Knight and Bishop would be} 1...

Bishop pair the two Knights will do best in a closed position such as this
one. Moreover, in this case the presence of the support point at f4 is a

in such position, for it enables White to start a minority attack on the
Queenside. The present position, however, is an exception which provides us
with a welcome chance of giving a warning against superficial thinking. How is
it that the minority attack give White such a promising initative in many
variations of the QGD? The reason must be that the Pb4-b5 of the minority
attack is a means of breaking the half-open c-file fully open. But this is not
the whole explanation. The essential point is that Black, who has the
half-open e-file, cannot be so prompt with his counterattack. His thematic
advance is ... Pf5-f4, and this need preparation. Preparation however needs
time, and White can use this time to push forward his b-pawn without delay. In
light of these considerations the difference between the present diagram and
the normal QG positions, in which the minority attack has legitimate
expectations of success, is clear enough. Black has already played ... Pf5 and
so will probably be able to play ... Pf4 before White can play Pb5 on the
other flank. In short, Black's minority attack gets in first} 11... exd5 12.

well aware of the fact that Janowsky was a great advocate of the two Bishops.

better he thought he had a won game, if he had some considerable advantage he
confidently expected his oponent to strike his colours. All of Lasker's

has an ulterior significance. The structure of the position will sooner or
later require Black to play ... Pc6, and the ideal post for his King would
typically be on c7, after which he could complete his development. However, it

usually anti-positional advance Pf4. This is because he will obtain strong
pressure on the newly opened f-file, whic, in conjunction with the
concentration of his minor pieces on or near the Black Kingside, will provide
enough pressure to compensate for the aforementioned positional liabilities.
In this game Tartakower utilizes these factors well, until a critical moment

with Anderssen, Marshall, and Spielmann. With subtle positional play he was
less at home; though in his later years he did operate routinely on positional
grounds while producing many fine endgames. Bogolyubov was an optimist. One of
his famous aphorisms was "When I am White I have the advantage because I am
White; when I am Black I have the advantage because I am Bogolyubov" His aims,
however, were apt to outrun his capabilities. His great talent was at times
just not great enough, and the occasional gross errors in his play were due to
this disharmony} 1. e4 {Around 1928 Bogolyubov wrote a book on the d-pawn

{5. BOTVINNIK (1910-1992) In some ways Botvinnik was a disciple of Lasker. He
was, like his great forerunner - first of all a great fighter. He revels in
difficult positions; but when necessary he also plays simple positions with
accuracy which is scarecely surpassable. his master stems from the harmony
which exists between his chess technique and his human attributes. His style
is distinguished by great originality. Ne never minds having his pawn position
shattered, providing that he thereby obtains free play for his pieces. In this
respect he goes much farther than Tarrasch, who spoke out in favour of having
an isolated d-pawn. Botvinnik was not only unafrad of an isolated d-pawn; he
quite frequently was prepared to accept doubled or even trebled pawns
Botvinnik not only thirst for battle; as a rule he is thoroughly prepared for
it. Several times he lost matches in defence of the World Championshpi - first
against Smyslov, then against Tal, and then against Petrosian. In two of these
cases - against Smyslov and tal - he had the opportunity for a return match,
and both times he made such thorough preparations, and directed those
preparations so accurately at the weaknesses of his opponents, that they were
no match for him. His skill in the deep and exhaustive analysis of adjounment
positions is scarecely rivaled. He has adopted his own particular repertoire
of openings, especially with the Black pieces. Against 1. Pe4 his first choice
of defence used to be the French and then the Sicilian, in keeping with his
preference for difficult positions. Later he often used the Caro-Kann,
especially when he needed a solid defence against the ferocious attacking
style of Tal} 1. d4 Nf6 (1... d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6.

positions; the difference is that Bronstein will take far greater risks. From
the first move to the last his games are usually struggles in which he devotes
much of his time seeking original, creative lines of play. These are tactics
motivated not only by the idea of forcing his opponent into prolonged thought,
but also by his desire to win as brilliantly as possible. This style has
something of Alekhine (his pawn sacrifices and his instinct fo breakthrough)
but also something of Tartakower (the best move is not necessarily the
strongest; preference may sometimes be given to a second best move in order to
confuse the opponent)} 1. d4 ({Porreca-Bronstein, Belgrade 1954} 1. e4 c6 2.

{7. CAPABLANCA (1888-1942) Capablanca was the possessor of a virtually perfect
technical style, but he was lazy, and had a degree of self-satisfaction which
made him incline towards superficiality. He had little patience, and was
seldom in the mood for hard work. Nevertheless, there was real inspiration in
his ability to forsee possible danger, and in the way he could nip it in the
bud long before it could amount to anything serious. As might be expected of
such a superb technician, he had a particularly fine feeling for liquidation.
All things considered, his was a style which tended more to defence than
aggression. Capablanca had no faith in principles, but only in good moves.
Since he usually steered clear of trenchant lines of play he developed
primarily into a specialist in the playing of simple positions} 1. d4 Nf6 2.

{8. CHAROUSEK (1873-1900) Charosek died young, and his immense talent never
was given a chance to fully ripen. It is said that as a schoolboy he found
Bilguer's great Handbuch in a public library and copied out the whole thousand
or so pages, memorizing much of it in the process. It is a strange story, but
this Hungarian was a strange figure. His handling of the openins, his feeling
for position and his flair for combination place him in the company of Morphy,
Pillsbury and Alekhine Although he lived at a time when the gambits offered
fewer chances than had been the case in Morphy's day, he showed a marked
liking for gambit play. Charousek's prime lasted only about two years
(1896-97) . The last three years of his life were a losing battle with

ingenious exponent of attacking play. From his own comments it appears that he
believed that his best talent was to be found in combinative play. The truth
is that the brilliance of his combinative play was so great that it obscured
the suprising fact that Chigorin lost more games through tactical mistakes
than strategical ones. Nowadays he is recognized as the founder of the modern

{FISCHER (Born 1943) Usually the style of a chessmaster has to grow; it may
take years before one may speak of any style at all. As a rule the young
player begins with pure combination, and then in the course of time finds that
he must add water to win. He learns the methods of positional play, and
develops endgame technique. It is quite possible to begin as a combinative
player - a tactician - and yet in maturing to acquire an out-and-out
positional style of play. The exceptional Grandmaster Fischer, however, is
another and almost unique story in modern chess. At the age of twenty he
already possessed a fully rounded style. He is both tactician and strategist,
an openings expert without peer, and a virtuoso of the endgame. The following
game against Reshevsky is a good example of his super-class, technical style}

player in his youth - but not only in his youth: in his maturity the same
description held good. The difference is that in his early days his
temperament ran head of his technique, so that sometimes his methods were too
risky and his combinations not sound. in his later years kereds matured into a
complete positional player, while acquiring a perfect knowledgeo f the
openings. Add to this fact that he had reached great heights in the endgame
and we see Keres as the possesor of the ideal style. Keres himself considered
that combinative play best suited his personality. His great skill in dealing
with complications was developed largely through correspondence play. In his
postal games his one aim was to build up the tension, and he used to steer for
complications right from the start. However, experience taught him that in the
end the accumulation of small advantages pays better than always going for the

{19. Em. LASKER (1868-1941) The style of Emanual Lasker was unique. He had not
quite the creative powers of Alekhine, nor quite such an intense will to win;
but instead he possessed incomparable skill in provoking erros and remarkable
ingenuity in exploiting them. His attentiveness, his powers of concentration
and his tactical prowess were nothing short of miraculous. He also had very
good nerves, evidenced by the fact that he made fewer nervous slips than
almost any other world class player (One of the very few instances on record
was his famous loss to Torre, Moscow 1925) The layout of his games was
generally quiet and unpretentious. One might describe him as lying in wait;
but he was certainly not passive. His defence was superb. In the openings he
like to create and maintain tension, and he never shrank from complications.
In the wildest positions he seemd to know better than anyone the best plan of
action, or - an even more difficult matter - which would be relatively best
Above all Lasker was a fighter. He probed the weak points in his opponents
amory. Against the positional player he would introduce every tactical
possibility; the combinative experts he would combat by positional means. In
pursuit of these ends eh would take great risks, there are instances on record
which he deliberately chose inferior lines for the sole purpose of getting his
opponent into the sort of position which he would feel ill at ease. Not did
Lasker content himself with seeking loopholes in his opponent's chess
technique: he went so far as to play upon weaknesses in their actual mental
make-up. He knew, for instance, that Janowsky set great store in the two
Bishops, and that he possessed boundless optimism. The combination of these
two factors meant that once Janowsky had the two Bishop he was apt to consider
the game as good as won - a mental attitude from which Lasker profited more
than once} 1. d4 (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. O-O

healty ambition with perfect technique. He collected small advantages and knew
well how to turn them to account at the right moment. One could call his style
"cumulative". He chose quiet openings, was an ingenious defender and a fine
exponent of the endgame. His Queen endings in particular were models of
endgame technique. In the matter of style Maroczy may be considered a disciple

combinative player of all time. But Morphy owed his remarkable achievements
not only to his admittedly tremendous combinative talents, but also to the

speak of perfection in a human being. Moreover, he had excellent technique. In
the maturity of his positional insight, Morphy was half a century ahead of his
time. While other racked their brains for the right procedure, Morphy simply
knew what to do. Unlike his contemporaries who played for complications on the

{28. RETI (1889-1929) During and after World War I there emerged a group of
young players who attempted to break completely with accepted opinion.
Foremost among them was Reti. Instead of occupying the centre with pawns these
hypermoderns, with Reti as their leader, preferred to control the central
territory by the action of their pieces. They developed their Bishops on the
flanks and held back the centre pawns as long as possible. In his innovations
Reti eventually went too far. He overpressed his theories, as inexperienced
players sometimes do, and was often the victim of practical difficulties} 1.

forms a bridge between Steinitz and the present day. He had a splendid grasp
of the requirements of a position and was an exceptionally fine attacker when

achievements will never be equalled. In Rook endings in particular his play
was simply phenomenal. Yet his play also had its deficiencies. Tactially he
was more fallible, as his games agains the great tactician Spielmann showed.

simple and sound. This is not to say that he is averse to combinative play -
there are many excellent examples of beautiful combinative games by Smyslov on
record. But his greatest strength seems to be in the art of making "something
out of nothing". He will maneuver patiently for hours at a time without ever
relaxing for one moment; he seems to be steathily stalking his opponent. There
is indeed something of the assassin about him, for all at once, when least
expected, he will strike. Since moreover his endgame technique is just about

weakness. "I can handle an attacking position just as well as Alekhine", he
said, "but in actual play I cannot often achieve such a position". Spielmann
was indeed a magnificent attacking player. The bravura with which he could
carry an attack through to a brilliant conclusion appealed as much to the
expert as it did to the public. His main weakness was a lack of opening
knowledge, and this deficiency revealed itself in an inability to build the
kind of position in which he could display his powers. On the other hand it
may also explain the success of this Austrian master against, for instance,
Rubinstein, whose way of building up his game also left something to be
desired. Spielmann's style calls to mind that of Chigorin. In sheer technique

{33. STEINITZ (1836-1900) Steinitz was the first player who really understood
Philidor, and especially Morphy. His games, and even more, his writings
establish him as the father of modern positional play. Things which today are
accepted without question - the occupation of the centre, the strength of the
two Bishops, the theory of weak squares - were revolutionary ideas in the days
of Steinitz. With all his gifts Steinitz has some definite weaknesses. Limited
powers of combination hampered him in deciding between what was correct in
theory and what was expedient in practise Steinitz was definitiely of the
materialistic attitude in chess. With intense will power and scientifice
argument he fought against the idea that a material deficit could be offset by
positional advantages which were not in themselves decisive. He was a great
defender, but he carried his ideas too far, sometimes imposing the rolde of
defender upon himself quite deliberately. Much of his life's work was devoted
to the demolition of gambits. "The only was to refute a gambit", said
Steinitz, "is to accept it". The dangers he was willing to face in support of
this dogma are shown in the following game} 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Ne7 4.

practical one, if less courageous and perhaps less profound. His style might
be described as "best-quality read made". In his later years he had to meet
all the novel ideas put forawrd by such players as Reti and Breyer, and
suffered many disappointments against younger players. Through his writings
Tarrasch did more than any man has done to reveal the secrets of good chess to
players in general. The many rules he laid down have put many a moderate
player on the right lines: Don not play Knights to the edge of the board;
occupy the centre with your pawns; constricted positions contain the seeds of
defeat; two Bishops are strong than two knights or Knight and Bishop; in the
endgame the Rook should be placed behind the passed pawn etc. But Tarrasch
proclaimed only the rules, and ignored the many exceptions. The influence of
Tarrasch is still felt today, and will apparently continue to be. His dislike
for constricted positions was so strong that he would accept a weakening of
his pawn strucutre in preference. In this respect he differed from Steinitz
who had a liking for defending constricted positions} 1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3.

style of analysis and clarity with which he could set out the essentials of
the position, we give here his note on this position: "Black has far and away
the better game. As regards material it is quite likely in the endgame a Rook
and two Bishops will turn out to be stronger than Rooks and a Knight;
furthermore the b-pawn is bound to fall. Black's centre is very strong, and
teh advance of the d-pawn and c-pawn will produce a pair of united passed
pawns. White is still uncastled, and Black can play to preven Kingside
castling by ... Ra8 and ... Ba6. The White Rooks have not a single open file
at their disposal, and the Knight is pinned. In reality White has only his
Queen in play. It is now up to Black to utilize his chances tactically. The
simplest way thought perhaps not the best, would be ... Qc5 followed by ...
Qxb6 and then advance the c-pawn. Black plays however to prevent castling, to
deprive the opponent of all good moves, to force all his pieces - especially
Knight - to unfavourable positions and finally reduce him to desparation}

{36. TARTAKOWER (1888-1956) Despite the fact that Tartakower played so much
chess and became so thoroughly experienced, his play was perpetually original.
As a lawyer, he knew the art of defending a weak case; as a chessmaster
nothing pleased him more than winning a game by means of a little known or
inferior variation. his play showed a clear preference for the methods of
Reti, Breyer and Capablanca without rejecting those of Steinitz or Rubinstein.
This is clear also in several books he wrote} 1. d4 Nf6 2. g3 {A very rare
choice at this juncture, but Tartakower loved to play unsual, even
bizzare-looking moves (though he was also an outstanding theorist)} 2... d5 3.

{37. TEICHMANN (1868-1925) Although Teichmann was generally admitted to be an
outstandingly capable player he seldom achieved the great things that were
expected of him. The explanation was certainly not a lack of talent or of
theoretical knowledge, but almost entirely in a casual attitude towards chess
competition. Teichman was lazy and all to ready to draw, but a mighty man if
he ran into difficulties} 1. d3 d5 2. Nd2 e5 3. e4 c6 4. Qe2 Bd6 5. f4 { A

{38. ZUKERTORT (1842-1888) Zukertort played thousands of games with the great
Anderssen. This must have been an excellent education in the realms of
combinative play in so far as he needed any educating in the art. Zukertort
was indeed a tremendously talented combination plyaer; morever, he avoided the
common error of his day, which was to play too wildly. From the positional
point of view, however, Zukertort never reached teh same heights. In both his
matches with Steinitz he was consistently outplayed in this sphere. His
failure was in finding of a plan appropriate to this requirements of the
positions. But once on the right plan, he was dangerous even to Steinitz} 1.
